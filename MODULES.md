# Module development notes

Ferron can be extended with both modules, which handle HTTP requests, and are essentially Rust crates, and DNS providers, which are also essentially Rust crates.

You can find both the [example Ferron module](https://github.com/ferronweb/ferron-module-example), and the [example Ferron DNS provider](https://github.com/ferronweb/ferron-dns-mock).
