We are excited to introduce Ferron 1.3.0, packed with powerful new features and enhancements.

## Key improvements and fixes

### Configurable error handling

Ferron now supports configurable error handling using a regular request handler. This allows developers to define custom error processing logic with greater flexibility and consistency across the application.

### Backend error interception

Weâ€™ve added support for intercepting error responses from backend servers. This enables greater control over how errors are reported and managed.

## Thank You!

We appreciate all the feedback and contributions from our community. Your support helps us improve Ferron with each release. Thank you for being a part of this journey!
