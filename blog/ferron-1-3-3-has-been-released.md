We are excited to introduce Ferron 1.3.3, where we have fixed a bug related to reverse proxying.

## Key improvements and fixes

### Reverse proxying on Docker

We've fixed an issue that caused 502 errors when using reverse proxying with Docker due to an operation being canceled. This resolves instability for users leveraging Ferron in Docker environments and ensures better compatibility and reliability.

## Thank you!

We appreciate all the feedback and contributions from our community. Your support helps us improve Ferron with each release. Thank you for being a part of this journey!
