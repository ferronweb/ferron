We are excited to introduce Ferron 1.3.5, with lower memory usage for Brotli and Zstandard compression.

## Key improvements and fixes

### Adjusted Brotli and Zstandard compression

We've adjusted the compression parameters for Brotli and Zstandard to reduce the memory usage, allowing for more memory-efficient compression.
