We are excited to introduce Ferron 1.3.6, with support for disabling X-Forwarded-\* headers for the reverse proxy.

This release is also the first release of Ferron 1.x since the development delay and the project rebrand.

## Key improvements and fixes

### Option to disable X-Forwarded-\* headers

Added support for disabling X-Forwarded-\* headers for the reverse proxy, allowing for more flexible reverse proxy header configuration.
