We are excited to introduce Ferron 2.0.0-beta.10, with new features, several improvements and fixes.

## Key improvements and fixes

### PROXY protocol support

Ferron now supports accepting connections that use the PROXY protocol. This allows better integration with load balancers and reverse proxies that rely on PROXY headers to forward client information.

### Improved compatibility with some terminal browsers

Fixed unexpected connection closure errors when using some terminal-based browsers such as `w3m` and `lynx`. Ferron now maintains more stable and reliable connections with these clients.

## Thank you!

We appreciate all the feedback and contributions from our community. Your support helps us improve Ferron with each release. Thank you for being a part of this journey!
