We are excited to introduce Ferron 2.0.0-beta.11, with a fix for some terminal browsers.

## Key improvements and fixes

### Improved compatibility with some terminal browsers

Fixed unexpected connection closure errors when using some terminal-based browsers such as `w3m` and `lynx`. The fix in Ferron 2.0.0-beta.10 was a partial fix. Ferron now maintains more stable and reliable connections with these clients.
