We are excited to introduce Ferron 2.0.0-beta.14, with new features and fixes.

## Key improvements and fixes

### Request and response buffering

We've added support for buffering request and response bodies. In particular, buffering request bodies can serve as an additional protection against Slowloris-style attacks.

### Location configuration security fix

We've fixed an issue causing incorrect location configuration to be applied when the URL would be replaced with a sanitized one.

## Thank you!

We appreciate all the feedback and contributions from our community. Your support helps us improve Ferron with each release. Thank you for being a part of this journey!
