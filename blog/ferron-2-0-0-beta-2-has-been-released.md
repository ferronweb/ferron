We are excited to introduce Ferron 2.0.0-beta.2, with new features, enhancements, and some important fixes.

## Key improvements and fixes

### Smarter configuration handling

A new configuration adapter has been added to automatically detect the correct configuration path when running the web server inside a Docker image. This eliminates manual setup and improves deployment consistency.

### Substring replacement module

Ferron now includes a module (`replace`) for substring replacement in response bodies. This can be useful for transforming dynamic content, templating, or modifying responses on the fly.

### Rate limiting module

Weâ€™ve introduced a rate limiting module (`limit`) to help prevent abuse and protect resources by limiting the number of requests per client.

### Post-quantum cryptography support

Added support for key exchanges using post-quantum cryptography, strengthening Ferron's security against future quantum threats. When we added this, we also switched the cryptography provider for Rustls from _ring_ to AWS LC.

### Error handling fix

Resolved an issue causing infinite recursion in the error handler, ensuring stable and predictable error processing.

### Improved YAML configuration translations

Fixed translation issues in the YAML configuration:

- The `errorPages` property is now correctly interpreted.
- The `users` property is also properly translated, enhancing configuration reliability.

### Clearer KDL parsing errors

KDL parsing errors are now formatted for better readability, making debugging configuration files much easier.
