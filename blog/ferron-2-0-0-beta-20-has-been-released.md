We are excited to introduce Ferron 2.0.0-beta.20, with a default access log format fix.

## Key improvements and fixes

### Default access log format fix

The server now logs the client IP address instead of the server IP address in the access log. This change ensures that the access logs provide accurate information about the client's IP address, improving on the usability of the logs.

## Thank you!

We appreciate all the feedback and contributions from our community. Your support helps us improve Ferron with each release. Thank you for being a part of this journey!
