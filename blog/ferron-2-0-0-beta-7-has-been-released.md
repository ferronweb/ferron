We are excited to introduce Ferron 2.0.0-beta.7, with a fix related to automatic TLS.

## Key improvements and fixes

### Automatic TLS contact address fix

Fixed an ACME error related to contact addresses, even if the contact address is valid. This allows Ferron to be used with ACME contact email addresses.

## Thank you!
