We are excited to introduce Ferron 2.0.0-beta.8, with a fix related to TCP connections.

## Key improvements and fixes

### Improved TCP Connection Handling

Fixed an issue where TCP connections were not properly closed when requested by the server, despite the previous fix. This improves stability and resource management.

## Thank you!
