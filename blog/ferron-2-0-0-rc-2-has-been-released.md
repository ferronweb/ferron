We are excited to introduce Ferron 2.0.0-rc.2, with several bug fixes.

## Key improvements and fixes

### ACME EAB bug fix

Fixed bugs related to ACME EAB (External Account Binding), allowing the usage of ACME EAB.

### FastCGI bug fix for fcgiwrap

Fixed bugs related to FastCGI, when using Ferron with fcgiwrap. This allows Ferron to work with fcgiwrap, which is a FastCGI server that executes CGI applications, and possibly other FastCGI servers.
