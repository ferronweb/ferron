We are excited to introduce Ferron 2.3.1, with a canceled I/O operation crash fix.

## Key improvements and fixes

### Canceled I/O operation crash fix

Improved robustness by gracefully handling canceled I/O operations that could previously cause a crash under rare conditions. This happened when io_uring was disabled.

## Thank you!
