Ferron has official packages available for Debian, Ubuntu, and derivatives. Below are the instructions on how to install Ferron on Debian or Ubuntu via a package manager.

## Installation steps

### 1. Add Ferron's repository

To add Ferron's repository, run the following commands (applicable for Debian and Ubuntu, if you're using a derivative, replace `$(lsb_release -cs)` with the closest matching Debian version codename):

```bash
# Install packages required for adding a new repository
sudo apt install curl gnupg2 ca-certificates lsb-release debian-archive-keyring

# Add the public PGP key
curl https://deb.ferron.sh/signing.pgp | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/ferron-keyring.gpg >/dev/null

# Add a new Debian package repository
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ferron-keyring.gpg] https://deb.ferron.sh $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ferron.list

# Fetch the package lists
