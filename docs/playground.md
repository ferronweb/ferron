If you like to try out Ferron without installing it first, you can try it out on [a community-maintained playground](https://tech-playground.com/playgrounds/ferron/).

This playground allows you to experiment with Ferron configurations in a safe and interactive environment. You can modify the server configuration and commands for performing HTTP requests on the server, and run the setup to see the results, without having to install Ferron locally.
