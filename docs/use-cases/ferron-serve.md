If you simply need to serve files on the local filesystem, you can
use the `ferron serve` command to do so. If you are familiar with
the [serve NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve), the
`ferron serve` command will offer similar functionality. See also
the help message from running `ferron serve --help` for supported
options.
