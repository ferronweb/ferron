    <h2>If you're just visiting this website</h2>
    <p>Thank you for visiting the website! Right now, the website is either not yet set up or has problems right
      now. Stay tuned!</p>
    <p>If you would like to let the administrators know that you've seen this page instead of the expected content, you
      should notify them, for example via email.</p>
    <p>For example, if the website is "example.com", you would send an email message to the website administrator at
      "webmaster@example.com".</p>
    <p><strong>Note: Ferron probably has nothing to do with this website or its content, it just provides the
        software for the website to run.</strong> If you have issues with this website, contact the
      administrator of the website, not Ferron.</p>

    <h2>If you're an administrator of this website</h2>
    <p>This page means that the web server's installation is successful. You can now add contents of the website to
      the webroot directory (<i>/var/www/ferron</i> if installed using Ferron installer for GNU/Linux or via
      Docker, or <i>%SystemDrive%\ferron\wwwroot</i> if installed using Ferron installer for Windows).</p>
    <p>You can configure your web server according to <a href="https://www.ferronweb.org/docs">Ferron's
        documentation.</a></p>
    <p><strong>Thank you for installing Ferron!</strong></p>
