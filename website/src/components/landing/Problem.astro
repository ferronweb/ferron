      title="Complex configurations"
      description="Have you spent hours configuring a web server just to set up a website? NGINX configs can become verbose, even for something as common as a high-performance reverse proxy. Apache's directives can be hard to navigate too, with many options that can make simple tasks needlessly hard."

      title="Security concerns"
      description="Many popular web servers (such as Apache and NGINX) are written in memory-unsafe languages (like C) and rely on low-level libraries. While mature and widely audited, this class of software has historically been more vulnerable to memory-safety bugs, such as Heartbleed in OpenSSL, increasing the potential impact of defects."

      title="Performance bottlenecks"
      description="Apache's traditional process- and thread-based architectures can be less efficient under high concurrency and modern workloads, often needing more resources to achieve the same throughput as newer, event-driven servers."
