        The problem with popular web servers
      </h2>
      <p class="text-muted-foreground text-lg max-w-2xl mx-auto">
        Despite powering much of the internet, popular web servers (such as
        Apache and NGINX) weren't designed for ease of use, security, or modern
        developer experience.

        description="Have you spent hours configuring a web server just to set up a website? NGINX configs can become verbose, even for something as common as a high-performance reverse proxy. Apache's directives can be hard to navigate too, with many options that can make simple tasks needlessly hard."

        description="Many popular web servers (including Apache and NGINX) are written in programming languages and use libraries that aren't designed for memory safety. This caused many issues, such as Heartbleed in OpenSSL, putting servers at unnecessary risk."
