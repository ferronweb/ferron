        The problem with popular web servers
      </h2>
      <p class="text-muted-foreground text-lg max-w-2xl mx-auto">
        Despite powering much of the internet, popular web servers (such as
        Apache and NGINX) weren't designed for ease of use, security, or modern
        developer experience.

        description="Many popular web servers (including Apache and NGINX) are written in programming languages and use libraries that aren't designed for memory safety. This caused many issues, such as Heartbleed in OpenSSL, putting servers at unnecessary risk."
