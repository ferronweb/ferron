        The problem with popular web servers
      </h2>
      <p class="text-muted-foreground text-lg max-w-2xl mx-auto">
        Despite powering much of the internet, popular web servers (such as
        Apache and NGINX) weren't designed for ease of use, security, or modern
        developer experience.

        description="Have you spent hours configuring a web server just to set up a website? NGINX configs can become verbose, even for something as common as a high-performance reverse proxy. Apache's directives can be hard to navigate too, with many options that can make simple tasks needlessly hard."

        title="Security concerns"
        description="Many popular web servers (such as Apache and NGINX) are written in memory-unsafe languages (like C) and rely on low-level libraries. While mature and widely audited, this class of software has historically been more vulnerable to memory-safety bugs, such as Heartbleed in OpenSSL, increasing the potential impact of defects."

        description="Apache's traditional process- and thread-based architectures can be less efficient under high concurrency and modern workloads, often needing more resources to achieve the same throughput as newer, event-driven servers."
