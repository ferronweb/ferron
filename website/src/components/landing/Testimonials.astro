        testimonial="I suspect that people don't like changing web servers, and perhaps that's why it took the industry so long to move away from Apache. Ferron actually looks great — great performance, automatic TLS, easy reverse proxy configuration and more. Congrats on shipping this!"

        testimonial="You may want to check out what Ferron is doing. I've been using it for a few months. Highly recommend. (...) Significantly easier to set up than nginx, and by far the most effortless auto TLS integration. (...) Highly recommend using the v2 docker images though. It now uses KDL for configuration, which is much cleaner than YAML. The syntax is versatile enough that you can create a custom DSL of sorts. Ferron uses it to replicate if statements, and uses them to filter access by IP or headers."
