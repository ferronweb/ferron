            <h2>If you're just visiting this website</h2>
            <p>
                Thank you for visiting the website! Right now, the website is
                either not yet set up or is having problems. Stay tuned!

                If you'd like to let the administrators know that you've seen
                this page instead of the expected content, you should notify
                them (for example via email).
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if the website is "example.com", you can send an
                email message to the website's administrator at
                "webmaster@example.com".
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong
                    >Note: Ferron probably isn't responsible for this website or
                    its content, they just provide the software for the website
                    to be running.</strong
                >
                If you have issues with this website, contact the website's
                administrator, not Ferron.
            </p>

            <h2>If you're an administrator of this website</h2>
            <p>
                If you see this page, this means the web server's installation
                is successful. You can now add contents of your website to the
                webroot directory (likely <i>/var/www/ferron</i> on GNU/Linux,
                or <i>%SystemDrive%\ferron\wwwroot</i> on Windows).
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also configure the web server according to
                <a href="https://ferron.sh/docs">Ferron's documentation.</a>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Thank you for installing Ferron!</strong></p>
